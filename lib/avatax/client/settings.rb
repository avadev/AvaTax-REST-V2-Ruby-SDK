      # The company settings system is a metadata system that you can use to store extra information
      # about a company. Your integration or connector could use this data storage to keep track of
      # preference information, reminders, or any other storage that would need to persist even if
      # the customer uninstalls your application.
      #
      # A setting can refer to any type of data you need to remember about this company object.
      # When creating this object, you may define your own `set`, `name`, and `value` parameters.
      # To define your own values, please choose a `set` name that begins with `X-` to indicate an extension.
      #
      # Use Set = Transactions, Name = TaxCodePrioritization/HSCodePrioritization and Value = Transaction/ItemMaster for prioritizing which TaxCodes/HsCodes should be used for calculating taxes.
      #
      # Example: To prioritize TaxCodes passed in a Transaction over values stored with Items when calculating tax, use
      # Set = Transactions, Name = TaxCodePrioritization, Value = Transaction
