      # Retrieve geolocation information for a specified US or Canadian address
      #
      # Resolve a US or Canadian address against Avalara's address validation system. Note that this API is
      # valid for US and Canadian addresses only.
      #
      # If the address can be resolved, this API provides the latitude and longitude of the resolved location.
      # The value `resolutionQuality` can be used to identify how closely this address can be located. If the
      # address cannot be clearly located, use the `messages` structure to learn more about problems with this address.
      # This is the same API as the POST /api/v2/addresses/resolve endpoint.
      # Both verbs are supported to provide for flexible implementation.
      #
      # In order to get any evaluation for an address, please provide at least one of the following fields/pairs:
      # 1. postal code
      # 2. line1 + city + region
      # 3. line1 + postal code
