      # A customer object defines information about a person or business that purchases products from your
      # company. When you create a tax transaction in AvaTax, you can use the `customerCode` from this
      # record in your `CreateTransaction` API call. AvaTax will search for this `customerCode` value and
      # identify any certificates linked to this `customer` object. If any certificate applies to the transaction,
      # AvaTax will record the appropriate elements of the transaction as exempt and link it to the `certificate`.
      #
      # A nested object such as CustomFields could be specified and created along with the customer object. To fetch the
      # nested object, please call 'GetCustomer' API with appropriate $include parameters.
      #
      # Before you can use any exemption certificates endpoints, you must set up your company for exemption certificate data storage.
      # Companies that do not have this storage system set up will see `CertCaptureNotConfiguredError` when they call exemption
      # certificate related APIs. To check if this is set up for a company, call `GetCertificateSetup`. To request setup of exemption
      # certificate storage for this company, call `RequestCertificateSetup`.

      # A customer object defines information about a person or business that purchases products from your
      # company. When you create a tax transaction in AvaTax, you can use the `customerCode` from this
      # record in your `CreateTransaction` API call. AvaTax will search for this `customerCode` value and
      # identify any certificates linked to this `customer` object. If any certificate applies to the transaction,
      # AvaTax will record the appropriate elements of the transaction as exempt and link it to the `certificate`.
      #
      # Before you can use any exemption certificates endpoints, you must set up your company for exemption certificate data storage.
      # Companies that do not have this storage system set up will see `CertCaptureNotConfiguredError` when they call exemption
      # certificate related APIs. To check if this is set up for a company, call `GetCertificateSetup`. To request setup of exemption
      # certificate storage for this company, call `RequestCertificateSetup`.
