      # Download a report
      #
      # This API downloads the file associated with a report.
      #
      # If the report is not yet complete, you will receive a `ReportNotFinished` error. To check if a report is complete,
      # use the `GetReport` API.
      #
      # Reports are run as asynchronous report tasks on the server. When complete, the report file will be available for download
      # for up to 30 days after completion. To run an asynchronous report, you should follow these steps:
      #
      # * Begin a report by calling the report's Initiate API. There is a separate initiate API call for each report type.
      # * In the result of the Initiate API, you receive back a report's `id` value.
      # * Check the status of a report by calling `GetReport` and passing in the report's `id` value.
      # * When a report's status is `Completed`, call `DownloadReport` to retrieve the file.
      #
      # * We throttle this API. You can only call this API up to 5 times in a minute.

      #
      # The `ExportDocumentLine` report produces information about invoice lines recorded within your account.
      #
      # To split large reports into multiple smaller partitions, use the numberOfPartitions and partition properties on ExportDocumentLineModel.
      #
      # Example - split a report into three partitions
      #
      # * Follow the steps above with numberOfPartitions = 3 and partition = 0
      # * Follow the steps above with numberOfPartitions = 3 and partition = 1
      # * Follow the steps above with numberOfPartitions = 3 and partition = 2
      # * Once all three reports are downloaded merge the files on the client side.
