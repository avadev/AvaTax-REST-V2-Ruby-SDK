      # Download a file listing tax rates by postal code
      #
      # Download a CSV file containing all five digit postal codes in the United States and their sales
      # and use tax rates for tangible personal property.
      #
      # This rates file is intended to be used as a default for tax calculation when your software cannot
      # call the `CreateTransaction` API call. When using this file, your software will be unable to
      # handle complex tax rules such as:
      #
      # * Zip+4 - This tax file contains five digit zip codes only.
      # * Different product types - This tax file contains tangible personal property tax rates only.
      # * Mixed sourcing - This tax file cannot be used to resolve origin-based taxes.
      # * Threshold-based taxes - This tax file does not contain information about thresholds.
      #
      # If you use this file to provide default tax rates, please ensure that your software calls `CreateTransaction`
      # to reconcile the actual transaction and determine the difference between the estimated general tax
      # rate and the final transaction tax.
      #
      # The file provided by this API is in CSV format with the following columns:
      #
      # * ZIP_CODE - The five digit zip code for this record.
      # * STATE_ABBREV - A valid two character US state abbreviation for this record. Zip codes may span multiple states.
      # * COUNTY_NAME - A valid county name for this record. Zip codes may span multiple counties.
      # * CITY_NAME - A valid city name for this record. Zip codes may span multiple cities.
      # * STATE_SALES_TAX - The state component of the sales tax rate.
      # * STATE_USE_TAX - The state component of the use tax rate.
      # * COUNTY_SALES_TAX - The county component of the sales tax rate.
      # * COUNTY_USE_TAX - The county component of the use tax rate.
      # * CITY_SALES_TAX - The city component of the sales tax rate.
      # * CITY_USE_TAX - The city component of the use tax rate.
      # * TOTAL_SALES_TAX - The total tax rate for sales tax for this postal code. This value may not equal the sum of the state/county/city due to special tax jurisdiction rules.
      # * TOTAL_USE_TAX - The total tax rate for use tax for this postal code. This value may not equal the sum of the state/county/city due to special tax jurisdiction rules.
      # * TAX_SHIPPING_ALONE - This column contains 'Y' if shipping is taxable.
      # * TAX_SHIPPING_AND_HANDLING_TOGETHER - This column contains 'Y' if shipping and handling are taxable when sent together.
