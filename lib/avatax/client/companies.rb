      #
      # Examines the most recent 100 transactions or data from the last month when verifying transaction-related integrations.
      # For partners who write integrations against AvaTax for many clients, this API is a way to do a quick self testing to verify whether the
      # written integrations for a company are sufficient enough to be delivered to the respective customers to start using it.
      #
      # This API provides messages specific enough (through predefined checks) to guide the partner on what integrations are still missing from the company to get fully certified.
      # The API makes the following checks to conclude if the company is NOT fully certified:
      # 1. Any past month items contains generic tax code of P0000000.
      # 2. All the companies on the requesting account are test companies.
      # 3. No Voided/Cancelled documents in the past 30 days.
      # 4. There are less than 2 committed documents.
      # 5. Any documentCode is a generic GUID string.
      # 6. Any customerCode on document is a generic GUID string.
      # 7. No document has more than 1 documentLine.
      # 8. All of the documents have missing exemptionNo, customerUsageType, taxDateOverride or negative amount.
      # 9. Any document quantity is a negative number.
      # 10. Any document have repeated lines.
      # 11. No document has shipping charge.
      # 12. All documents have same ItemCodes, descriptions and taxCodes.
      # 13. Less than 2 addresses used across all documents.
      # 14. Whether locationCode was used in documents.
      # 15. Account with AvaGlobal subscription and no documents have VATBuyerId.
      # 16. Any document has currencyCode not being USD for accounts with AvaGlobal subscription.
      # 17. All documents have countryCode used for accounts with AvaGlobal subscription.
