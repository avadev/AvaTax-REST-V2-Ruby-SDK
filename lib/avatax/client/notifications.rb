      # Mark a single notification as dismissed.

      # Marks the notification identified by this URL as dismissed.
      #
      # A notification is a message from Avalara that may have relevance to your business. You may want
      # to regularly review notifications and then dismiss them when you are certain that you have addressed
      # any relevant concerns raised by this notification.
      #
      # An example of a notification would be a message about new software, or a change to AvaTax that may
      # affect you, or a potential issue with your company's tax profile.
      #
      # When you dismiss a notification, the notification will track the user and time when it was
      # dismissed. You can then later review which employees of your company dismissed notifications to
      # determine if they were resolved appropriately.
      #
      # A Global notification with null accountId and companyId cannot be dismissed and will expire within a given time span.
